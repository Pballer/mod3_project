# NBA Analysis Project

#### In this repo you will find analytical tools for pulling detailed NBA data and stastical libraries for comparing sample distributions.

We focused on analyzing the Bucks and their start player Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Our goal is to advise our readers on how to efficiently place bets.  We review home vs away performance and how large the winning spread is.  This will allow our readers to confidently place higher stakes bets to maximize returns.
